# Embedded-Systems-Foundations-PIC16F887-STM32F103C6
This repository contains bare-metal C implementations of core microcontroller peripherals (GPIO, timers, interrupts, UART, ADC, PWM), developed using MPLAB X, Keil µVision, and validated with Proteus simulations. The focus is on register-level understanding, hardware-ready firmware, and junior embedded engineer–level workflows.
